# THE WANDERER'S WIZARDRY

## What is Wanderer's Wizardry?

Wanderer's Wizardry is a new game I'm developing centered around becoming the most powerful mage in existence.
The ambitious main character has dreams of becoming the greatest in all of the world and will stop at nothing to achieve this.
But everyone has to start from the bottom. After all, how will you take on the world if you can't beat a couple of rats?

## Mechanics

Wanderer's Wizardry will be centered around magical combat. Your foes will range from rats to humans and fantasy monsters, armed with all kinds of weaponry. Combat will be turn based with each party having a set amount of action points to use during their turn. You will be able to combine multiple spells into a devastating `combo attack`. Your character will slowly get better at casting stronger magic and you will also get better at chaining different attacks together. 

## Development

The core mechanics of the game are now there. The player is able to fight enemies and level up. It is possible to visit different locations within the city, but they are mostly deserted.

## The world

The most basic idea is that you are a free man. Not a serf or baron bound to any small plot of land, but a wandering individual with no class nor income. You will have to scrape by to survive at first, but quickly you should be able to become a fine adventurer and earn enough to live like a lord. The world you live in will be designed based on medieval Europe with fantasy characteristics. I will also attempt to include some European folklore and mythology in the game.

## Features to come

Here is a list of features I have planned and will thus attempt to implement in the game.

- `Adventurer's Guild`. The guild will allow you to take on requests to earn some money and climb the ranks. **STARTED**
- `Dungeons`. Dungeons will be highly challenging locations with great rewards.
- `Multiple foes`. Battles can have between 1-2 enemies. **DONE** 
- `Become a mercenary`. You can enlist as a mercenary and fight in a campaign for some gold.
- `Large skill tree`. You will be able to improve your spells and learn new ones by leveling up. **STARTED**
- `NPC relations`. You can form bonds with NPCs and gain some bonuses for doing so.
- `Turn to crime`. You can become a bandit or a pickpocket if you enjoy making lots of money with lots of risk.
- `Quests`. Doing quests will net you awards and can help you navigate the world. **STARTED**
